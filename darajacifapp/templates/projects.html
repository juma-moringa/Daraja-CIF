                        <p>With support from Porticus Africa Foundation, Daraja partnered with the Centre for Research &
                            Innovations in East Africa (CRI-EA) and Mukuru Child Welfare Center (MCWC) in the 2018-2019
                            period to lead/coordinate formative research to inform the design and development of an ECD
                            programme on Strengthening Protection, Education and Care for Children (SPEC) in Nairobi
                            County. The study was to help the partners better understand the integration of child
                            protection in early childhood, care, education & development (ECD) in urban informal
                            settlements of Nairobi;- and assess how current early childhood development systems,
                            socio-economic practices, and knowledge affect responsive caregiving, healthy child
                            development, safety and educational achievements of children aged 0-8 years in the Mukuru
                            and Mathare urban informal settlements of Nairobi City County. The research further helped
                            Daraja, MCWC, and their local partners to understand the existing ECCED knowledge,
                            practices, and policies to identify areas where there is momentum for change to catalyze

                        <p>in partnership with Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) to test an innovative model of quality,
                            cost-effective, and contextually relevant childcare centers that had the potential to be
                            taken to scale. The project increased access to quality ECD services for over 180 children
                            aged three months to four years. The project was implemented in Baba Dogo informal
                            settlement in Kasarani sub-county, Nairobi County and achieved 3 outcomes; (i) improved
                            knowledge, attitudes, and practices among caregivers, parents, and health workers in support
                            of childrenâ€™s physical, cognitive, and social development; (ii) improved quality and
                            cost-effectiveness of contextually relevant, sustainable and replicable baby care centers;
                            and (iii) documentation of best practices.</p>
